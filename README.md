Hi there! 👋 I'm an aspiring Web Developer with a background in Psychology 👩‍🎓.  

The decision to change my career path in early 2020 was not easily made, especially coming from a non-technical field. Still, envisioning myself contributing to the society in web development was the moment I realised my passion and potential to become who I want to be!
