Hi there! :wave: I'm an aspiring Web Developer with a background in Psychology :woman_student:.  

My decision to change my career path in early 2020 was not easily made, especially coming from a non-technical field. Still, envisioning myself contributing to the society in web development was the moment I realised my passion and potential to become who I want to be!
